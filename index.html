<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>
I am an experienced software architect from Dayton, Ohio with a focus on web-based technologies, data visualization, and user interface design. Through my experiences as a defense contractor supporting the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), I have led many large scale, technically challenging projects through design, development, and delivery. My experience in a wide variety of software technologies and agile development techniques have enabled me to excel both as a developer and as a team lead. In addition to my day job at Applied Information Sciences, I also teach Computer Science courses to evening students at Sinclair Community College, and am the lead organizer for the Dayton Data Visualization users group.

    Security Clearance: TS/SCI. Lead Software Engineer for NGA Innovisionâ€™s GIAT Research and Development lab at NASIC. The main focus of the lab is the rapid prototyping of new capabilities for use across the intelligence community. Performed a wide variety of software development tasks, from gathering, mining, and warehousing extremely large datasets, to developing forward-looking user interfaces utilizing HTML5, JavaScript, and other cutting-edge technologies. To manage the large number of prototypes and data services we provided to the community, and to facilitate quick bug-fixes and easy maintenance, I set up a continuous delivery service based on Hudson to auto-deploy and install code to production once it had passed unit tests.
