# Michael Bowman
I am an experienced full stack software engineer from Dayton, Ohio, who has led many projects through design, development, and delivery. My expertise is in building web-based mapping and data visualization applications with JavaScript. Through my experiences as a developer and team lead, I have worked with a wide variety of software technologies and development techniques. In addition to my day job, I teach Computer Science courses to evening students at Sinclair Community College, and volunteer on the leadership teams for the Dayton Data Visualization and Code for Dayton meetups.
